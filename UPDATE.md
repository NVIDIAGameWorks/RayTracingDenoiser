## To v3.1

*NRD* requires explicit definitions of `NRD_USE_OCT_NORMAL_ENCODING` and `NRD_USE_MATERIAL_ID` to avoid a potential confusion when NRD was compiled using one set of values, but an application uses other values. The *CMake* file has been modified to simplify *NRD* integration into projects, where it is used as a *Git* submodule. Now these macro definitions are exposed as *Cmake* options.

## To v3.2

- removed `PrePassMode`
- added `maxSupportedMaterialBitNum` and `isCompiledWithOctPackNormalEncoding` to `LibraryDesc`

  - removed `diffuseHistoryRejectionNormalThreshold`
  - removed `minLuminanceWeight` and added separated `diffuseMinLuminanceWeight` and `specularMinLuminanceWeight`

  - `REBLUR_FrontEnd_PackRadianceAndHitDist` renamed to `REBLUR_FrontEnd_PackRadianceAndNormHitDist`
  - `REBLUR_FrontEnd_PackDirectionAndHitDist` renamed to `REBLUR_FrontEnd_PackDirectionAndNormHitDist`
  - `REBLUR_BackEnd_UnpackRadianceAndHitDist` renamed to `REBLUR_BackEnd_UnpackRadianceAndNormHitDist`
  - `REBLUR_BackEnd_UnpackDirectionAndHitDist` renamed to `REBLUR_BackEnd_UnpackDirectionAndNormHitDist`
  - `RELAX_BackEnd_UnpackRadianceAndHitDist` renamed to `RELAX_BackEnd_UnpackRadiance`
  - removed `NRD_GetCorrectedHitDist`

## To v3.6

- *REBLUR*:
  - Removed `SpecularLobeTrimmingParameters`
- *NRD.hlsli*:
  - Removed `NRD_GetTrimmingFactor`

## To v3.7

`NRD_USE_OCT_NORMAL_ENCODING` and `NRD_USE_MATERIAL_ID` replaced with more explicit `NRD_NORMAL_ENCODING` and `NRD_ROUGHNESS_ENCODING` to offer more encoding variants out of the box.

- *API*:
  - removed `maxSupportedMaterialBitNum` and `isCompiledWithOctPackNormalEncoding` from `LibraryDesc`
  - added `normalEncoding` and `roughnessEncoding` to `LibraryDesc`
- *REBLUR*:
  - Removed `enableAdvancedPrepass`

## To v3.8

Introduced optional `NRDEncoding.hlsli` file which can be included prior `NRD.hlsli` to properly setup NRD encoding for usage outside of NRD project, if encoding variants are not set via Cmake parameters. Also introduced optional `IN_DISOCCLUSION_THRESHOLD_MIX` which allows to smoothly mix `CommonSettings::disocclusionThreshold` (0) into `CommonSettings::disocclusionThresholdAlternate` (1).

- *API*:
  - Exposed `IN_DISOCCLUSION_THRESHOLD_MIX`, `CommonSettings::disocclusionThresholdAlternate` & `CommonSettings::isDisocclusionThresholdMixAvailable`
- *REBLUR*:
  - Removed `minConvergedStateBaseRadiusScale`
  - Removed `maxAdaptiveRadiusScale`

## To v3.9

- *API*:
  - Removed `DenoiserCreationDesc::enableValidation`
  - Exposed `CommonSettings::enableValidation`
  - Extened `CommonSettings::motionVectorScale` to 3 floats

## To v4.0

Since *NRD* tracks specular motion, now, if requested, it can modify provided *diffuse*-like motion in `IN_MV` with internally computed *specular*-like motion if specularity is high. For this purpose an optional `IN_BASECOLOR_METALNESS` input has been added. This feature improves behavior of spatio-temporal upscalers, like *TAA* or *DLSS*.

- *API*:
  - Introduced `CommonSettings::isBaseColorMetalnessAvailable`
  - Reworked `DenoiserDesc` to clearly indicate that there are 3 types of resources each of which "sits" in a predefined `space` (`set` in *VK*):
    - constant buffer - binding is shared across all pipelines
    - samplers - bindings are shared across all pipelines
    - resources - bindings vary per pipeline
  - Name changes:
    - `isHistoryConfidenceInputsAvailable` => `isHistoryConfidenceAvailable`
    - `Resource` => `ResourceDesc`
    - `DescriptorRangeDesc` => `ResourceRangeDesc`
    - `ComputeShader` => `ComputeShaderDesc`
    - `DescriptorSetDesc` => `DescriptorPoolDesc`
    - all `fooNum` => `foosNum`
  - `GetComputeDispatches` return type changed to `void`
- *REBLUR*:
  - Exposed `specularProbabilityThresholdsForMvModification` to control diffuse / specular motion mixing
- *RELAX*:
  - Removed `enableSpecularVirtualHistoryClamping`

## To v4.1

SH (spherical harmonics) have been replaced with SG (spherical gaussians). It unlocks physically-based high quality diffuse & specular resolve. The following functions have been added to `NRD.hlsli` (or renamed):
- `NRD_SG_ExtractColor` - extracts unresolved denoised radiance
- `NRD_SG_ExtractDirection` - extracts light dominant direction
- `NRD_SG_ExtractRoughnessAA` - extracts modified roughness (increased in areas with high normal variance)
- `NRD_SG_ResolveDiffuse` - reconstructs diffuse macro details
- `NRD_SG_ResolveSpecular` - reconstructs specular macro details
- `NRD_SG_ReJitter` - reconstructs diffuse & specular micro details (resurrects jitter vanished out after denoising)
- `NRD_SH_ResolveDiffuse` - reconstructs diffuse macro details using SH resolve (for comparison only)
- `NRD_SH_ResolveSpecular` - reconstructs specular macro details using SH resolve (for comparison only)

## To v4.2

A single NRD instance can now include any combination of denoisers, including repeating ones (for example, `RELAX_DIFFUSE`, `RELAX_DIFFUSE` and `SIGMA_SHADOW`). Transient memory pool is internally optimized to reduce memory consumption.

- *API*:
  - Introduced `Identifier` to distinguish one denoiser in the instance from another one
  - Introduced `SetCommonSettings`
  - `GetComputeDispatches` now expects a list of identifiers, specifying which denoisers collect dispatches for
  - Added explicit `CommonSettings::cameraJitterPrev` and `CommonSettings::resolutionScalePrev` (since `SetCommonSettings` can be called several times per frame)
  - Name changes (including sub-name usages):
    - `Denoiser` => `Instance`
    - `Method` => `Denoiser`
    - `fullResolutionWidth` => `renderWidth`
    - `fullResolutionHeight` => `renderHeight`

    - removed `CommonSettings::resolutionScale` and `CommonSettings::resolutionScalePrev`

    - removed `TextureDesc::mipNum`
    - removed `ResourceDesc::mipNum` and `ResourceDesc::mipOffset`
  - simplified number of samplers
    - removed `Sampler::NEAREST_MIRRORED_REPEAT` and `Sampler::LINEAR_MIRRORED_REPEAT`

- *REBLUR*:
  - removed `historyFixStrideBetweenSamples`
- *RELAX*:

  - removed `enableReprojectionTestSkippingWithoutMotion`
- *REFERENCE*:
  - `IN_RADIANCE` renamed to `IN_SIGNAL`
  - `OUT_RADIANCE` renamed to `OUT_SIGNAL`

## To v4.5

- *API*:
  - `ResourceDesc::stateNeeded` renamed to `ResourceDesc::descriptorType` to match `ResourceRangeDesc::descriptorType` because the former is a concatenation of the latter

## To v4.6

- *REBLUR*:
  - `blurRadius` renamed to `maxBlurRadius`
  - exposed `minBlurRadius` with the default value matching older versions

## To v4.7

- *SIGMA*:
  - removed `blurRadiusScale`
  - exposed `lightDirection`, which is needed only for directional light sources
  - exposed `stabilizationStrength'
  - clarified usage:
    - `float shadow = SIGMA_BackEnd_UnpackShadow( OUT_SHADOW_TRANSLUCENCY );`
    - `float3 translucentShadow = SIGMA_BackEnd_UnpackShadow( OUT_SHADOW_TRANSLUCENCY ).yzw;`

## To v4.8

- *API*:

  - `IN_SHADOW_TRANSLUCENCY` renamed to `IN_TRANSLUCENCY` (describes optional translucency)

    - `IN_SHADOWDATA`: `SIGMA_FrontEnd_PackPenumbra` (2 variants: for infinite and local light sources)
    - `IN_SHADOW_TRANSLUCENCY`: `SIGMA_FrontEnd_PackTranslucency`
- Deprecated and removed with all dependencies:
  - `SPECULAR_REFLECTION_MV`
  - `SPECULAR_DELTA_MV`

## To v4.9

- *API*:
  - exposed `ReblurSettings::hitDistanceStabilizationStrength` allowing to control the responsiviness of ambient and specular occlusion in the temporal stabilization pass and reach parity with `REBLUR_OCCLUSION` if set to `0`
  - `MemoryAllocatorInterface` renamed to `AllocationCallbacks`
  - exposed `CommonSettings::strandMaterialID`, enabling "under-the-hood" tweaks for hair (and grass) denoising
  - exposed `CommonSettings::strandThickness`, defining how NRD adapts to sub-pixel thick details. It works in conjunction with `CommonSettings::disocclusionThresholdAlternate` for `CommonSettings::strandMaterialID` without a need to provide `IN_DISOCCLUSION_THRESHOLD_MIX` texture
- *REBLUR*:
  - changed usage of `maxBlurRadius` and its default value, old values should be scaled by `2`

## To v4.10

- *NRD INTEGRATION*:
  - `Nrd` prefix replaced with `nrd::` namespace
  - removed `format` from `NrdIntegrationTexture`, which is now just `nri::TextureBarrierDesc`

  - `luminanceAntilagPower` replaced with `luminanceSensitivity`

  - tweaked the default values for `ReblurAntilagSettings`
  - the new default value for `planeDistanceSensitivity = 0.02` matches the behavior for the old value `0.005`
  - slightly reduced `lobeAngleFraction` to squeeze more normal details (it's safe to use the old value `0.2`)
- *SIGMA*:
  - `stabilizationStrength` replaced with `maxStabilizedFrameNum`
  - the new default value for `planeDistanceSensitivity = 0.02` matches the behavior for the old value `0.005`

## To v4.12

  - (re)introduced `historyFixBasePixelStride` to maximize flexibility (the default matches old behavior)

## To v4.13
- *REBLUR/RELAX*:
